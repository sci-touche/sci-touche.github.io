# About Sci-Touche

Sci-Touche is a project created by Assumpta Gasana and Nancy Ingabire Abayo in order to help improve practical education in Rwanda and other countries in East Africa.

There is power in hands-on education, specifically for regions where there are no technical terms in native and everyday languages. Having access to equipment will facilitate the translation while sparking creativity in the youth of Rwanda, and East Africa.
