# Sci-Touche

Welcome to the homepage for the Sci-Touche Project. Sci-Touche is a project created by [Assumpta Gasana](https://twitter.com/Assu_Gasana) and [Nancy Ingabire Abayo](https://twitter.com/N_IngabireAbayo) in order to help improve practical education in Rwanda and other countries in East Africa.

There is power in hands-on education, specifically for regions where there are no technical terms in native and everyday languages. Having access to equipment will facilitate the translation while sparking creativity in the youth of Rwanda, and East Africa.

Here you will find information and links about Sci-Touche and all our activities.
