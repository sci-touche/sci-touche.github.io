## The "why" of Sci-Touche Rwanda

Nancy and Assumpta both pursued their pre-college education in Rwanda and did not have access to appropriate resources to aid in their understanding of various STEM subjects. After starting their college education in the United States, they both started to notice having more difficulty with some of these courses that required applying certain scientific concepts. They had assumed this was just because they had a different way of learning. However, after extensive research, surveys, and talking to other students, they understood that the issues had a deeper root and was shared among other students.
